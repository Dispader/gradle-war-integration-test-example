# Gradle Web Integration Test Example Project

This application focuses on the narrow task of splitting an integration runtime in Jetty for the simplest application which implements the Gradle War plugin.

# usage

* `git clone https://github.com/Dispader/gradle-war-integration-test-example.git`
* `./gradlew jettyRun`
